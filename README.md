# OpenTableChallenge

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the OpenTable challenge, focusing on a Reservation app. It utilizes modern Android development tools and follows best practices in software architecture and design patterns.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build the project using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.

## Usage
Once the project has been built successfully, you can run it on an Android device or an emulator.

## Libraries
This project makes use of several key libraries:

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building native UI.
- **Navigation Component**: To handle in-app navigation.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing.
- **Kotest**: An elegant Kotlin test framework.
- **MockK**: Mocking library for Kotlin.
- **Turbine**: A test library for Kotlin Flow.

## Architecture and Design Patterns
The application is structured following the Clean Architecture principles and includes the following design patterns:

- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures separation of concerns by dividing the project into layers.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts the data layer to provide a clean API for data access to the rest of the application.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Facilitates a separation between the app's UI logic and the business logic.
- **Data Sources**: Responsible for handling data operations.

## Areas of Improvement
Due to time constraints, the following areas of improvement were identified but not implemented:

- **Optimization of the Scheduler Algorithm**: Enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheduling logic.
- **Integration of Dependency Injection (DI)**: To improve the manageability and scalability of the code.
- **Handling Corner Cases in Unit Testing**: Strengthening the test suite by covering more edge cases.
- **Implementation of Android Catalog Versions**: Ensuring compatibility and optimization across different Android versions.
- **Improvements in UX/UI**: Enhancing the user interface and user experience for better usability and appeal.

These areas represent opportunities for future development and enhancements.
